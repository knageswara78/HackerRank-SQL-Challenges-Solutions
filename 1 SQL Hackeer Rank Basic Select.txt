Never late than  now.

 Practise Hacker Rank SQL problem solutions for Oracle.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Select

1.

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-the-select-query/problem

i.
SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = "USA" and population > 100000
SQL command not properly ended

ii. Added semi colon at end.
SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = "USA" and population > 100000;
"USA": invalid identifier

iii. USA double quotes changed to single quote.
SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'USA' and population > 100000;

SELECT * FROM city WHERE COUNTRYCODE  = 'JPN';

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6.

7.

SELECT CITY, STATE from STATION;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8.

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-3/problem

Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. 
Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.


mysql ok:
SELECT distinct CITY from STATION WHERE Id % 2 = 0;

oracle:
SELECT distinct CITY from STATION WHERE Id % 2 = 0;

invalid character

Replaced mysql % with MOD to solve in oracle:

SELECT distinct CITY from STATION WHERE MOD(Id,2) = 0;

or
select distinct city from station where mod(id,2) = 0;

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-4/problem

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.


SELECT count(CITY) - count(distinct CITY) from STATION;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10 Very Difficult in n Oracle.

Weather Observation Station 5
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths 
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

mysql ok:

select city,length(city) 
from station
order by length(city) desc,city limit 1;
select city,length(city) 
from station
order by length(city) asc,city limit 1;

oracle:

order by length(city) desc,city limit 1
*
ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended

order by length(city) asc,city limit 1
*
ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended

New solution  1:
select city,length(city) from 
(select city,rownum as rid from 
 (select city,length(city) from station order by length(city),city)) 
  where rid = 1 or rid = (select max(rownum) from station);
 
New solution 2: 
select t1.* from (select City, length(City) from station order by length(city) desc, city) t1 where rownum <= 1 
union 
select t2.* from (select City, length(City) from station order by length(city) , city) t2 where rownum <= 1;  

or Instead  <= 1 ,used = 1 at end.

select t1.* from (select City, length(City) from station order by length(city) desc, city) t1 where rownum = 1 
union 
select t2.* from (select City, length(City) from station order by length(city) , city) t2 where rownum = 1;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11 Difficult. Use substr in oracle along with lower or upper inside substr.

Weather Observation Station 6

Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


Note worked:
select distinct city from station
where city like 'a%' or 'e%' or 'i%' or 'o%' or 'u%';

mysql:
worked:
select distinct city from station where city like 'a%' or city like 'e%' or city like 'i%' or city like 'o%' or city like 'u%';
or

select distinct city from station where substring(city,1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u'); 
or

select distinct city from station where city regexp '^[aeiou].*';


Oracle:
no:
select distinct city from station where city like 'a%' or city like 'e%' or city like 'i%' or city like 'o%' or city like 'u%';

no:
select distinct city from station where substring(city,1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u'); 

"SUBSTRING": invalid identifier

Note: It should be substr not substring.

no:
select distinct city from station where city regexp '^[aeiou].*';

invalid relational operator

Oracle WORKED:
select distinct city from station where substr(lower(city),1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u'); 
or 
select DISTINCT CITY from STATION where SUBSTR(UPPER(CITY),1,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U');

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12 Difficult.

Weather Observation Station 7

select distinct city from station
where city regexp '*.^[aeiou]$';

select distinct city from station where city regexp '[aeiou]$';




worked:

2 solutions in mysql:

select distinct city from station where right(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u'); 

select distinct city from station where city regexp '[aeiou]$';

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13 Difficult

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-8/problem


Mysql:

worked:
worked:
select distinct city 
from station
where city regexp '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';



Orale:

now worked:
select distinct city 
from station
where regexp_like(lower(city),'^[aeiou]')
intersect
select distinct city 
from station
where regexp_like(lower(city),'[aeiou]$');

worked:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(LOWER(CITY), '^[aeiou]') 
intersect 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM 
STATION 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(LOWER(CITY), '[aeiou]$');

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14 Difficult

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-9


mysql:
not worked:
select distinct city
from station
where city regexp['^[aeiou].*'];

worked:
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');





Oracle:

now worked:
select distinct city
from station
where not regexp_like(lower(city),'^[aeiou].*');

or without .* at end.
select distinct city
from station
where not regexp_like(lower(city),'^[aeiou]');




worked:
SELECT distinct CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(city ,'^(A|E|I|O|U)');

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15 difficult

mysql:

worked:

select distinct city
from station
where right(city,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');


Oracle:

worked:

select distinct city
from station
where substr(city,-1,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now onwards only Oracle, not mysql:

Oracle:

fail:
select distinct city
from station
where regexp_like(lower(city),'^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$');


pass:
select distinct city
from station
where 
lower(substr(city,0,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u') or
lower(substr(city,length(city),1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17 or changed to and

select distinct city
from station
where
lower(substr(city,0,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u') and
lower(substr(city,length(city),1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

18 > 75 marks difficult


select name
from students
where
marks > 75
order by lower(substr(name,length(name)-2,3)),id;



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19. Easy

select name
from employee
order by name;

20.  Easy
